Sequence Models
===============

This mini-course is designed to give you a hands-on introduction to classic
sequence models used in bioinformatics. It is expected that you have some
previous knowledge in:

+ Unix/Linux command line
+ Programming in Python
+ Molecular biology

Setup
-----

Before you begin, you need to install a few programs and libraries.

+ Conda
+ Specific conda environment w/ yaml
	+ blast
	+ emboss?
	+ other shit
	+ pip3 installs...
	+ cluster, get the conda off your home
+ 





Thoughts

+ A bunch of demos in 90 minutes
+ Mini-workshop of sorts
+ Code examples
+ Demonstrations that work
+ Everyone can do this

Content

+ Measures of accuracy
+ Scoring matrices
+ Regular expressions
+ PWMs
+ WAMs
+ HMMs
+ NNs

What about decision trees, SVMs, etc? I should include whatever I can find in
sklearn.
